abstract = {A new method for performing a nonlinear form of Principal Component Analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernelfunctions, one can efficiently compute principal components in highdimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinearmap; for instance the space of all possible d pixel products in images.We give the derivation of the method and present experimental resultson polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.},
