	abstract = {In medical information retrieval research, automatically classifying X-ray images based on body-parts is a challenging problem. In {ImageCLEF}'s 2015 campaign there was a contest where the participants were challenged to cluster X-ray images into different groups based on presence of particular body-part in that X-ray image. In brief the challenge was to classify given X-ray images primarily into five groups which were: head-neck, body, upper-limb, lower-limb and true-negative. In our approach to solve this task we extracted features from the given images using dense multi-scale {SIFT}, used Elkan k-means clustering to create visual dictionary of extracted features, Randomized {KD}-Tree to speed up the Elkan K-Means, Spatial Pyramid Histogram as image descriptors to train Chi-kernel based {SVM} as classifier. Proposed system is able to classify X-ray images into one of the five classes with 85 percent accuracy.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the biological nervous system. Decision Support System ({DSS}) has been identified as one of the important solution providers in the emerging field of Artificial Neural Networks. Medical Decision Support System ({MDSS}) is an interactive Decision Support System software, which is designed to assist physicians and other health professionals in decision making tasks and to diagnose the patient disease. The Medical Decision Support System reduces the diagnosis time and improves the accuracy of the diagnosis. One of the clinical tests performed to diagnose Congenital Heart Septum Defect is the Chest Radiography (X-Ray) through the contour of size, position and shape of the heart. In order to diagnose Congenital Heart Septum Defect, a physician analyzes the chest X-ray and extracts the features like heart size measurements. But manual extraction of features and diagnosis is a difficult task for a physician. Therefore, in the present study, an algorithm is developed to automatically analyze and to extract the features from Chest X-ray using Image Processing Techniques. Also, a Decision Support System is developed to Diagnose the Congenital Heart Septum Defect based on chest X-ray features using Backpropagation Neural Network model. The Network is trained by using a Delta Learning Rule. The proposed feature extraction algorithm and Decision Support System are implemented in {MATLAB} with {GUI} features.},

A typical bone ailment is the fracture, which occurs when bone cannot withstand outside force like direct blows, twisting injuries and falls. Automatic detection of fractures in bone x-ray images is considered important, as humans are prone to miss-diagnosis. The main focus of this paper is to automatically detect fractures in long bones and in particular, leg bone (often referred as Tibia), from plain diagnostic X-rays using a multiple classification system. Two types of features (texture and shape) with three types of classifiers (Back Propagation Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine) are used during the design of multiple classifiers. A total of 12 ensemble models are proposed. Experiments proved that ensemble models significantly improve the quality of fracture identification.},

	abstract = {Brain Computer Interface ({BCI}) is the method of communicating the human brain with an external device. People who are incapable to communicate conventionally due to spinal cord injury are in need of Brain Computer Interface. Brain Computer Interface uses the brain signals to take actions, control, actuate and communicate with the world directly using brain integration with peripheral devices and systems. Brain waves are in necessitating to eradicate noises and to extract the valuable features. Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) is a functional pattern classification technique which is trained all the way through the error Back-Propagation algorithm. In this paper in order to classify the mental tasks, the brain signals are trained using neural network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Artificial Neural Network. Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) is a dominant tool for analyzing data and finding patterns in it. In Principal Component Analysis, data compression is possible and it projects higher dimensional data to lower dimensional data. By using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network, the redundant data in the dataset is eliminated first and the obtained data is trained using Neural Network. {EEG} data for five cognitive tasks from five subjects are taken from the Colorado University database. Pattern classification is applied for the data of all tasks of one subject using Neural Network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network. Finally it is observed that the correctly classified percentage of data is better in Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network compared to Neural Network alone.},

An overview of different artificial intelligent techniques is presented in this paper along with the review of important clinical applications. RESULTS The proficiency of artificial intelligent techniques has been explored in almost every field of medicine. Artificial neural network was the most commonly used analytical tool whilst other artificial intelligent techniques such as fuzzy expert systems, evolutionary computation and hybrid intelligent systems have all been used in different clinical settings. DISCUSSION Artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to be applied in almost every field of medicine.

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},
